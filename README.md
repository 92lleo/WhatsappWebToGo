-free and without ads-

With a clean and easy interface it's fun to use - it even shows up as running on an android phone on the phone where whatsapp is installed!

This is a beta, if you have problems just send a mail, create a github issue or use the private google play beta feedback

This was initially a proof of concept to try some things with the android webview. The app design is bad, i'll refactor it for 1.0
